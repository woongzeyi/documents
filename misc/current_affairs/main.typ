PUTRAJAYA: Malaysia has called for an immediate ceasefire in Lebanon amid the
rising death toll and widespread damage to infrastructure, warning that the
continued conflict could lead to a wider regional escalation.

In a statement on Thursday (Sept 26), the Foreign Ministry expressed grave
concern over the escalating conflict in the Middle East and strongly condemned
the attacks by the Israeli regime in Lebanon, which have claimed the lives of
over 600 people and caused significant damage to infrastructure.

"Malaysia calls for an immediate end to the conflict which would otherwise risk
a wider regional escalation," the statement read.

In support of diplomatic efforts to end the conflict, the Foreign Ministry said
Malaysia welcomed the Sept 25 joint statement by the United States, Australia,
Canada, European Union, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, United Arab
Emirates, the United Kingdom and Qatar, which calls for an immediate ceasefire
in line with UNSC Resolution 1701 (2006).

The ministry said Malaysia strongly underlines the necessity of implementing
UNSC Resolution 2735 (2024) to bring to an immediate end the genocide and the
humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza.

"Malaysia reaffirms its commitment to promoting peace, dialogue, and cooperation
in the pursuit of justice, security as well as international peace. Malaysia
continues to support all efforts aimed at achieving a just and lasting solution
to the ongoing conflicts," it added. – Bernama

KLUANG: Perikatan Nasional's Badrul Hisham Shaharin, otherwise known as
Chegubard, has doubled down on his claims that Barisan Nasional's Mahkota
by-election candidate had previously been arrested.

This was despite Kluang OCPD Asst Comm Bahrin Mohd Noh's earlier statement
saying that Barisan's Syed Hussien Syed Abdullah has no criminal record.

During a ceramah at a café in Taman Sri Kluang here on Thursday (Sept 26),
Badrul said it was a fact that Syed Hussien had previously been arrested and he
had the document to prove it.

"I did not show the official report (of the arrest) because I might get into
trouble as it is a confidential document. But I will show it to the audience
tonight," he said on Thursday (Sept 26) night.

Badrul Hisham also revealed the name and identification number of the policeman
who lodged the report along with details of Syed Hussien's apparent arrest.

Umno president Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi had said that the incident
happened when Syed Hussien was in his 20s, when he defended a blind person from
being harassed and assaulted by a group of people.

Syed Hussien is in a straight fight against Perikatan candidate Mohamad Haizan
Jaafar in the Mahkota by-election, with polling day set for Saturday (Sept 28).

= Mahkota polls: Keep cool, Zahid tells govt parties as campaign enters home stretch

_MOHD FARHAAN SHAH_

KLUANG: With polling in the Mahkota by-election less than two days away, Barisan
Nasional chairman Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi has urged unity government
component parties to maintain their cordial ties.

The Deputy Prime Minister, who is also Umno president, said there should not be
any statements issued that could hurt the feelings of others.

“Let us not, at the last moment, make statements that hurt our friends' hearts.

"We also ask our friends not to utter any words that will hurt our hearts
either,” he said in his speech at the Felcra Madani Santuni Rakyat programme in
Paloh here on Thursday (Sept 26).

He also urged everyone to pray for clear skies and good weather on polling day
which falls on Saturday (Sept 28).

Ahmad Zahid said it was better for unity government members to keep their eyes
and ears open, rather than their mouths.

“Hold it in even if you do not agree with something. We will not lose anything
that way, but we will lose if we (speak harshly) of others," he said.

Ahmad Zahid said generous and kind gestures would be reciprocated with an open
heart, "and that is what we want".

He said the new political landscape had brought different viewpoints and
ideologies together in the spirit of unity, and reminded Umno members to remain
humble if the party emerges victorious from the by-election.

The Mahkota by-election is a straight contest between Barisan candidate Syed
Hussien Syed Abdullah and Perikatan Nasional’s Mohamad Haizan Jaafar.

The state seat fell vacant following the death of its incumbent, Datuk Sharifah
Azizah Syed Zain, on Aug 2.
